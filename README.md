## 🎨 Branding Philosophy

PotGrowHub merges **nature and technology**.
Designs follow the **organic geometry** of plant growth and the **flow of data** — balancing earth tones with glowing accents.

Color identity draws from:

* **Green Spectrum:** vitality and clarity
* **Gold:** prosperity, energy
* **Purple Hues:** calm, creative depth

Typography uses **Poppins** and **Inter**, chosen for modern readability and digital flow.
